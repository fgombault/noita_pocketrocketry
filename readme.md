Computes a wand signature to variably enhance explosion size 0.3-3x while holding that wand.

Without modifying the wands themselves, the mod applies an effect similar to the Glass Cannon perk to each wand you possess, varying the explosive capability of each wand you encounter by up to three times the normal magnitude. Noita yourself with your bomb wand! Throw the world's most disappointing nuke!

Should be compatible with everything (the mod only adds a variable to the player and a shot component to go with it), spells should no longer implode if the explosion radius is too small.

Configuration options

* How explosively varied the wands you find happen to be
* Maximum explosion scale from x1 to x10
* Wether to also affect damage and projectile speed
* Give each new wand a unique name
* What kind of hint the name gives you about its explosive properties
